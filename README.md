#### ABSTRACT: Increasing energy consumption in the transportation sector in the US results in a challenging greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and environmental problems. This paper involved integrated assessments on GHG emissions and emergy of the life cycle for the internal combustion engine (ICE) automobiles and electric automobiles in the USA over the entire assumed fifteen-year lifetime. The hotspots of GHG emissions as well as emergy indices for the major processes of automobile life cycle within the defined system boundaries have been investigated. The potential strategies for the reduction of GHG emissions and emergy in the life cycle of both ICE and electric automobiles were further proposed accordingly. Based on the current results, the total GHG emissions from the life cycle of ICE automobiles are 4.48E + 07 kg CO2-e which is 320 times higher than that of the electric automobiles. The hotspot area of the GHG emissions from ICE automobiles and electric automobiles are operation phase and the manufacturing process, respectively. Interesting results were observed that comparable total emergy of the ICE automobiles and electric automobiles have been calculated which were 1.54E + 17 and 2.20E + 17 sej, respectively. Analysis on emergy index evidenced a better environmental sustainability of electric automobiles than ICE automobiles over the life cycle due to its higher ESI. To the authorsâ€™ knowledge, it is the first time to integrate the analysis of GHG emissions together with emergy in the industrial area of automobile engineering. It is expected that the integration of the emergy and GHG emissions analysis may provide a comprehensive perspective on eco-industrial sustainability of automobile engineering.

#### ABSTRACT: In recent years, global warming has become a growing concern around the world, and greenhouse gases (GHG) are its major cause. In the current study, the GHG emissions from stainless steel production in Mainland China were evaluated based on two approaches. One (i.e., Approach I) was based on the data, which were collected from a life cycle inventory database (Ecoinvent). The second evaluation (i.e., Approach II) was performed according to the 2015 comprehensive energy consumption data of the Chinese stainless steel industry. When Approach I was employed, the results demonstrated that 1.44 kg CO2-e of total GHG emissions were generated for producing 1 kg of stainless steel. When adopting Approach II, the average GHG emissions based on comprehensive energy consumption from four stainless steel manufacturers in Mainland China were calculated to be 1.76 kg CO2-e/kg stainless steel. Further, the main hotspot area of GHG emissions for stainless steel production was found to be the blast furnace (BF) process, based on Approach I. Accordingly, employing an independent electric arc furnace (EAF) instead of a BF-EAF, as well as choosing clean technologies and updating obsolete and low-efficiency equipment, is recommended. It is expected that these two approaches can help stakeholders formulate a sustainable strategy for stainless steel production. And more broadly, provide some insights into adopting an appropriate framework for the evaluation of GHG emissions in industrial areas.

#### ABSTRACT: Steel production is an environmentally sensitive process accounting for 10% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in China, which represents 4-5% of the world's total anthropogenic GHG emissions. This study presents and compares three GHG emissions accounting methods for steel production in China, which are the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method, the Life Cycle Inventory Localization (LCIL) method, and the Comprehensive Energy Consumption (CEC) method. Different criteria such as sources of data, energy input-based, and process-based analyses, and benefits and limitations of the three methods are compared and discussed. On the basis of the data collected and system boundary defined in this study, the total GHG emissions of the IPCC, LCIL, and CEC methods are estimated as 1.717, 1.715, and 1.959 kg CO2-e/kg steel, respectively. The results of the IPCC and CEC methods show that the coal and coke combustion contributes 90.2% and 84.5% of total energy-related GHG emissions during steel production in China, respectively. For the LCIL method, it quantifies the GHG emissions from each individual sub-processes associated with the sintering process to the electric arc furnace process. The results of the LCIL method indicates that the hotspot area for GHG emissions during steel production is the blast furnace process, which accounts for 78.4% of the total energy-related GHG emissions. These three methods can be applied to other countries to investigate their GHG emissions. Moreover, the comparison of these three methods provides insights for adopting appropriate methods to calculate GHG emissions for steel production.
